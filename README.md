*game does not actually look like this* I wish

This game is a new take on the classic Battleship

At the start of the game, ships are placed automatically based on the specifications given by the User.

Throughout the game, the user will shoot multiple shots each round (the number of shots is respective to the number of ships alive currently for the User)

There are two modes for the game local and multiplayer (This is determined by the command line arguments - Hopefully will remake this in JavaFX so there's less for the user to do)

The multiplayer works by creating a Socket object and connecting to the server (server stuff is available in another repo, jar is included in this repo)
